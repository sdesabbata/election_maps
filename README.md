# Election maps

The 2019 UK General Election dot map provides an overview of the geographic distribution of votes casted per UK constituency during the 2019 UK General Election, and its intersection with population density. Each dot represents 10 votes casted for one party in a constituency, and it is colour coded by the [party colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Index_of_United_Kingdom_political_parties_meta_attributes).

The map combines [election results data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Z1YbmmjzDqMl2rzrk0XTfNrbRJDAMtU/view) ([not verified](https://twitter.com/eldenvo/status/1205525303092756482)) by [Alex Denvir](https://twitter.com/eldenvo) and [geographic data](https://github.com/alasdairrae/wpc) by [Alasdair Rae](https://twitter.com/undertheraedar).
